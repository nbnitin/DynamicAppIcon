# DynamicAppIcon

Icon files need to be bundled and listed in your plist file therefore they may not be dynamically added (only set).

If you even downloaded and write the icon but still bundle of iOS application can't be modified

You can only add files to your App's Documents directory. The main bundle can't be modified after your App has been released. Read the documentation on how to write to the directory.

This will help to update application's icon without resubmitting the app, only draw back is that aleternate app icon must already be part of your application

also, check include all assets under general section
